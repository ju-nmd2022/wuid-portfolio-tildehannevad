      <p>
        We got an assignment to create a streaming site, and I decided to do one
        about feelgood movies. We created these ones in Figma and it was really
        fun and easy. I decided to go with a blue background one the clickable
        sites and a picture of a sky on the front site. Simple and happy was the
        vibe that I were searching for. I created a site for feelgood which is
        movies which is funny and not at all draining for your mind. Neither are
        they scary or unpleasent. This is also something that I think is missing
        in exicting streamingsites.
